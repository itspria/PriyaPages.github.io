    I'm Priya. This a sample html about myself.
    Because programmers must be able to write code as well as identify and debug errors, programmers often specialize in only a few programming languages. With coding bootcamps on the rise, it’s not uncommon for programmers to be self-taught or come from interdisciplinary backgrounds, such as computer or information science. In most cases, experience trumps education when it comes to coding knowledge.

    This is about my HTML page.
    Now that you know what each role serves within the development process, let’s take a look at six of the key differences between software engineers and programmers, which we’ve highlighted below.
    <br>
    Keep in mind that, despite the differences, these titles are subject to employer preference. You can hire a candidate who calls themself a software engineer for your open programmer role as long as you make the job requirements and responsibilities extremely clear. It comes down to your candidate persona and job description; make sure the two are in alignment to hire the most qualified candidate for these highly technical roles.
